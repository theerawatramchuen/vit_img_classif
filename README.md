#### Setup
1. Unzip "dataset_ebs.zip" (for your project it is your dataset zip file with subfolder is the image class name<br/>
2. Run "dataset_spliter.ipynb" with editing dataset folder name and define the % of training and validation prior run <br/>
3. Run "vit_ebs.ipynb" with editing dataset directory in cell 3th prior run for the model training, model weight saving and prediction <br/>
