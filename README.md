# Custom Image Classification Using Vision transformer
Image Classification Using Vision transformer from Scractch

### Steps to follow:
#### Installation:
Anaconda Python Environment <br/>
version is working for CPU or (GPU) <br/>
Python 3.8 <br/>
torchvision 0.16.1 <br/>

vit-pytorch 1.6.4 (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) <br/>
#### Setup
1. Unzip "dataset_ebs.zip" (for your project it is your dataset zip file with subfolder is the image class name<br/>
2. Run "dataset_spliter.ipynb" with editing dataset folder name and define the % of training and validation in the 1st cell prior run <br/>
3. Run "vit_ebs.ipynb" with editing dataset directory in the 3th cell prior run for the model training, model weight saving and prediction sample images<br/>
